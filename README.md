### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer. My first experience with programming was back in 2018, I bought a book called 'The Self-taught Programmer', I learned basic Python, which later helped me when I started college. I have done multiple courses in Udemy (I really programming and learning new things). In May 2023 I started the Backend Development program with BloomTech, this course was jointly developed with Amazon. 

I have experience with: 
* Java
* DynamoDB
* API Gateway
* Cloudformation
* AWS Lambda
* Git
* AWS CLI
* And others 

My current plan is to continue developing my programming skills to ultimately land a job as Software Engineer.
